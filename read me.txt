The info on three test txt files: bipartite, random graph and fixed agree


bipartite graph with:
 
m=10
n=20
porbability=1
capacity=30

Max flow = 150


fixed dgree:

100v-5out-25min-200max
	100 vertices
	5 edges out of each node
	capacities range from 25 to 200
	max flow: 517


random graph:
